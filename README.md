# Odin Project Exercise - Sign-up Form

## Overview

Hello everyone! This project is an exercise from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a sign-up form for an imaginary service. The form includes basic validation logic to ensure that user inputs meet certain criteria, such as matching passwords and valid email formats. It also provides a user-friendly interface with visual feedback for validation errors.

## Features
- **Responsive Form Layout**: The form is designed to be user-friendly with a clear layout that is easy to navigate.
- **Password Validation**: Users receive immediate feedback if their passwords do not match.
- **Error Messaging**: Clear messages are displayed to guide the user in correcting their inputs.
- **Custom Styling**: The form uses custom fonts and colors to create a unique aesthetic.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the form and page content.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling and layout, including flexbox and CSS variables.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Form validation and DOM manipulation logic.
